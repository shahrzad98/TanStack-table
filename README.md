# DivOperation Front-End React based application

---

### Installation

The Project is Dockerized, all you have to do is simply run the following commands:

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

##### Important Note:

Even though the terminal log says that it's running on port 3000, **the app runs on port 3001**, you can visit localhost:3001 to see the app. I couldn't figure out a way to manipulate terminal logs and I didn't want to spend too much time doing so.
